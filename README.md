# Larimar Theme

Larimar is a rare and enchanting gemstone, found exclusively in the Dominican Republic. Known as the "Stone of the Caribbean," it captivates with its soothing shades of blue, ranging from pale sky tones to deep turquoise, reminiscent of the ocean's gentle waves. This pectolite mineral, formed in volcanic cavities, carries a serene beauty that evokes tranquility and clarity, making it an ideal inspiration for a coding theme designed to create a calm and focused development environment.

Discovered in the 1970s and named after the Spanish word for sea, "mar," Larimar is celebrated for its unique patterns and calming energy. This theme channels the gemstone’s serene and refreshing aesthetic, offering a visually harmonious workspace that enhances productivity and creativity.
